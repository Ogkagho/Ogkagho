- 💼 I'm looking for a job:
  > "Excuse me, I'm looking for a job. In fact, I've made up my mind to find a career that I can learn and grow into. Who am I? I'm a hard worker, I set high goals, and I've been told that I am persistent. Now, I'm not fooling myself. Having been raised with the self-esteem movement so popular in schools, I used to expect my needs to be considered. But I know that today's work culture no longer caters to the job loyalty that could be promised to earlier generations. What I believe is that good things come to those who work hard. And that people who reached the top of their fields didn't just fall there. My motto is if you want to win the lottery, you have to make the effort to buy a ticket."
